There are no restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear.The specified
access level remains in effect until the next access specifier or the end of the class
body.
The members which are accessible to all parts of the program should be defined after a
public specifier.
The members which are accessible to the member functions of the class but are not acc-
essible to the code that uses the class should be defined after a private specifier.

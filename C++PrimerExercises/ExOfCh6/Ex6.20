It is a common mistake to define parameters that a function does not change as (plain) references,in which case we should define them as reference to const.
Doing so gives the function's caller the misleading impression that the function might change its argument's value.
Moreover,using a reference instead of a reference to const unduly limits the type of arguments that can be used with the function.

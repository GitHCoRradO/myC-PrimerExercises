Way 1:
vector<int> ivec(10,42);
Way 2:
vector<int> ivec{42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42};
Way 3:
vector<int> ivec;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	ivec.push_back(42);

My preferred way of initializing such kind of vector:way 1.Such kind of vector has elements of the same value,thus making it very easy and swift to use way 1 to create such a vector.

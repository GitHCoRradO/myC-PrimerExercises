(a)
int calc(int, int);
int calc(const int, const int);

the second calc takes two paramters both of type const int and returns int.
it is illegal,for top-level consts are ignored.these two functions have the same parameter list.

(b)
int get();
double get();

the second get takes an empty list of paramters and returns double.
it is illegal,for only the return type differs.

(c)
int *reset(int *);
double *reset(double *);

//even with different return types,this is still overloading.
the second reset takes a pointer to double and returns a pointer to double.legal.

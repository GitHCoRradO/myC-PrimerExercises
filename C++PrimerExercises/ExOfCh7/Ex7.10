if (read(read(cin, data1), data2))
read(cin,data1) reads the data in cin and writes them to data1.if it successes,it returns a reference to cin.
then the next read( ... , data2) reads the following data in the stream to data2.and if that successes as well,it returns a reference to cin.
finally,cin will be tested as the condition of if.

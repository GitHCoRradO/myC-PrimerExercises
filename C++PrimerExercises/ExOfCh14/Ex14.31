StrBlobPtr has two data members,one of class type weak_ptr<vector<string>>,the other of built-in type size_t.
when an object of StrBlobPtr is destroyed,the corresponding destructor of weak_ptr<vector<string>> will be
called to destruct the corresponding data member wptr.
similar processes apply to copy and copy assignment operations.

I think the synthesized version will handle the copy,copy-assignment and destruction processes well enough.

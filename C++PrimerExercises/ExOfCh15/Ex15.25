Disc_quote has a constructor that takes 4 parameters.if we do not define a default
constructor,the compiler will not synthesize one,thus making the default constructor
deleted.any classes derived from Disc_quote will have deleted a default constructor.
//what if I explicitly declare a default constructor in Bulk_quote?is this another form
//of overriding?
//answer:
//if the default constructor(or copy constructor,copy-assignment operator or destructor)
//in the base class is deleted or inaccessible,then the corresponding member in the
//derived class is defined as deleted,because the compiler cannot use the base-class
//member to construct,assign,or destroy the base-class part of the object. 
//
//in the light of this,if the base class has a deleted default constructor,and the
//derived class explicitly declare a non-deleted default constructor,the code would
//not compile.

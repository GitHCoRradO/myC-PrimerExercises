(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) {/*....*/}
the loop condition is in error.
iter is defined in the condition,and it is not initialized.at the same time of iter being created,the iter != s.end() expression tries to compare s.end() with the
undefined object iter.the result is undefined.
(b)while (bool status = find(word)) {/*...*/}
   if (!status) {/*...*/}
in the condition of the while statement,status is defined and initialized with the return of find(word).
if expression find(word) returns true,which means word is found by function find,then status is initialized with bool value true.the while loop body in this 
condition will be executed.then the if statement test whether status is false,in this case(status being true), !status yields false,the if body will not executed.
if expression find(word) returns false,meaning word is not found be function find,the while body will not be execute.next,the condition of if statment-- !status--
yields true,its body will be executed.

auto p = new int();	//p is a built-in pointer pointing to an object of type int with value 0 in free store.
auto sp = make_shared<int>();	//sp resembles p in almost every aspect except that sp is a shared_ptr.

(a)	process(sp);
legal.
pass sp to function process.

(b)	process(new int());
illegal.
we cannot implicitly convert a built-in pointer to shared_ptr.


(c)	process(p);
illegal.
again.we cannot implicitly convert a built-in pointer to shared_ptr.

(d)	process(shared_ptr<int>(p));
legal.
shared_ptr<int>(p) constructs a temporary shared_ptr from p and pass that temporary shared_ptr to process.

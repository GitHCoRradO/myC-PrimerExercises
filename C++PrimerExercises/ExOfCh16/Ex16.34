template <class T> int compare(const T&, const T&);

(a) compare("hi", "world");
"hi" has type const char[3],while "world" has type const char[6].these types do not match.
thus the call is in error.

(b) compare("bye", "dad");
both have type const char[4].so this statement will compile.
T is char*.

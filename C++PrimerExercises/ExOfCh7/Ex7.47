making the constructor explicit
pros:
1.prevent the use of a constructor in a context that requires an implicit conversion.for instance,the string null_book probably represents a nonexistent ISBN.
2.prevent the copy form of initialization.
cons:
1.sometimes contexts that require implicit conversions are not so bad.on the contrary,these contexts may be a bit convenient for users.

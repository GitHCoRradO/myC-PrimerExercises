friend is a mechanism by which a class grants access to its nonpublich members.They have the same rights as members.
Pros:
1.the usefuls functions can refer to class members in the class scope without a prefix of the class name.
2.friends can access all nonpublic members conveniently.
3.making code more readable to users of the classes.
Cons:
1.weakens encapsulation and in turn maintainability.
2.code verbosity:declarations inside and outside the class.

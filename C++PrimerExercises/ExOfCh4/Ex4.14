if (42 = i)		//42 is an integer literal,which is rvalue.42 cannot be the left-hand operand of an assignment operator.
if (i = 42)		//if i is not a modifiable lvalue,then the expression i = 42 is in error.if i is a modifiable lvalue, i = 42 yields i,which has value 42
,which,when converted to bool type,equals true.so the condition is true.

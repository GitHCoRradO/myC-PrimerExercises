Parameters are local variables defined in the parentheses following the function name.Variables defined in the function body are also local variables.
local static variables are local variables in function bodies with static specifier.Each local static variable is intialized before the first time execution passes through
the objects' definition.Unlike local objects,local static objects are not destroyed when a function ends.They are destroyed when the program terminates.

Example:

void fck_1(int v1) {
	int i = 0;
	static int j = 0;
	//......
	return;
}

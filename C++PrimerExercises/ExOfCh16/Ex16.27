(a) function declaration.the parameter type is an instantiation of template class Stack<char>.
    code for Stack<char> will not be generated until this function is called.
(b) (c)
class Exercise has two data members of template class.
code for Stack<double> and Stack<int> will not be generated until class Exercise is used.
(d) declaration of sc uses template class type Stack<char>.
code for Stack<char> is generated here.
(e) call to f1 takes an argument of type Stack<char>.and code for Stack<char> has been generated in (d),thus the same code will not be generated again.
(f) not very sure if Stack<string> is instantiated here.
I feel code is generated for Stack<string> here.

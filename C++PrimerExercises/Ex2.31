r1 = v2;   //v2 has top-level const.it is an ordinary const int.r1 refers to an int v1.this statement copies v2 into v1.(edited:legal)
p1 = p2;   //both p1 and p2 has low-level const.p2 is copied into p1.(edited:p2 has a low level const,while p1 does not.illegal.)
p2 = p1;   //both p1 and p2 has low-level const.p1 is copied into p2.(edited:p1 is a pointer to int.we can convert it to a pointer to const int.legal.)
p1 = p3;   //both p1 and p3 has low-level const.p3 is copied into p1.(edited:same reason as the 2nd statement.illegal.)
p2 = p3;   //both p2 and p3 has low-level const.p3 is copied into p2.(edited:legal)

Similarities:
1.Overloaded operators have the same precedence and associativity as the corresponding built-in operators.

Differences:
1.An overloaded operator function must either be a member of a class or have at least one parameter of class type.
2.A few operators guarantee the order in which operands are evaluated.The overloaded versions of these operators do not
preserve the order of evaluation and/or short-circuit evaluation,it is usually a bad idea to overload them.
  In particular,the operand-evaluation guarantees of the logical 'AND',logical 'OR',comma operators are not preserved.
Moreover,overloaded versions of '&&' or '||' operators do not preserve short-circuit evaluation properties of the built-in
operators.Both operands are always evaluated.
3.We can call an overloaded operator function directly in the same way that we call an ordinary function.

yes,it does change the output of the previous exercise.

numbered a, b = a, c = b;
//	assume that a.mysn being 1,b.mysn could be 2,c.mysn could be 3.
f(a);
//	arguments of f are passed by value.then the copy constructor of class numbered is used.
//so f(a) will create a temporary object of type numbered inside the body and print the unique serial number of that object(assuming it being 4)instead of a.
f(b);	//unique temp serial number being 5
f(c);	//6
//these 2 statements work out similarly.

the output will be like:
4
5
6

back_inserter returns an insert iterator bound to that container.
an inserter iterator can add elements to a container.
ordinarily,when we assign to a container element through an (ordinary) iterator,we assign to the element that iterator denotes.
when we assign through an insert iterator, a new element equal to the right-hand value is added to the container.

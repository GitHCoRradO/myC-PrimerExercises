(a) array
It requires fixed number of words.even though it also requires alphabet order,I may move the elements manually,as I insert new words.
(b) deque
element number unknown.add new element at the back,but delete them from the front.so I may not use vector.deque would meet these requirements perfectly.
(c) list or forward_list
element number unknown.and when adding new integers,I must keep the elements in order.if I use vector or deque,it would take a lot of time to manully move existing elements.and since list and forward_list allow inserting elements at any position,they would be a best choice.after inserting all elements,I may iterate through the list or forward list to print the sorted elements.

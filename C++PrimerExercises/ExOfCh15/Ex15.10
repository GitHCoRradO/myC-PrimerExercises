inside read function,the actual work of reading data is done by the input operator >>.
the first parameter of read is a reference to std::istream.
because std::ifstream derives from std::istream,it is ok to bind a std::ifstream object to
a reference to std::istream.
inside std::istream and std::ifstream,input operator >> is a virtual function.
when the body of read is run,the version of >> is dependent on its left hand operand's
dynamic type.

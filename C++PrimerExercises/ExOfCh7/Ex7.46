(a) untrue
we can provide a class without any constructor.if a class does not define any constructor,the compiler might generate a so-called synthesized default constructor for it.
(b) untrue
A default constructor is one that is used when an object is created and no initializer is supplied.
A constructor that supllies default arguments for all its parameters also defines the default constructor.
(c) untrue
the class should still define one.( I am not very clear about what this "meaningful" refers.)
(d) untrue
the compiler generates a default constructor automatically only if a class declares no constructors.

Names used in declarations,including names used for the return type and types in the parameters list,must be seen before they are used.

in the light of this,
void dummy_fcn(pos height);		//it uses unknown type name for its parameter.
pos cursor = 0;
pos height = 0, width = 0;		//these declarations use unknown type name.
					//pos cannot be found in the class body before these declarations.and it cannot be found in the enclosing scope of the class before the class definition.

int ix = 1024, *pi = &ix, *pi2 = new int(2048);
typedef unique_ptr<int> IntP;

(a)	IntP p0(ix);
illegal.	trying to initialize unique_ptr with a int value.
(b)	IntP p1(pi);
illegal.	trying to initialize unique_ptr with a plain pointer to local object.
(c)	IntP p2(pi2);
legal.
(d)	IntP p3(&ix);
illegal.	&ix is a reference to a pointer to ix.the reason is the same as that of (b)
(e)	IntP p4(new int(2048));
legal.
(f)	IntP p5(p2.get());
illegal.	trying to initialize unuque_ptr from another unique_ptr.

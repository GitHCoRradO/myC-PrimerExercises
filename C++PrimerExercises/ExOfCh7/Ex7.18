Encapsulation is the separation of implementation from interface.It hides the impleme-
ntation details of a type.In C++,encapsulation is enforced by putting the implementat-
ion in the private part of a class.
Encapsulation provides two important advantages:
User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulated object.
The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without requiring ch-
anges in user-level code.

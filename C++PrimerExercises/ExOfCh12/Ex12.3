the complier does not complain a thing about adding const versions of push_back and pop_back.

push_back and pop_back does not modify data,which is a pointer, but rather the underlying vector data points to,which is perfectly legal to do with a const pointer or a plain pointer.

yet adding const push_back and pop_back does not seem quite logical.it may not be needed.
const or not const,we are only changing its underlying object.

here is a concrete example,

StrBlob sb1;
StrBlob sb2;
sb2 = sb1;

both sb1 and sb2 have one non-static private data member.
assigning sb1 to sb2 is acctually equivalent to the following

sb1.data = sb2.data;

for this data member is a shared_ptr,this assigment uses the copy-assignment operator of shared_ptr class.

after the assigment,the reference count of the previous shared_ptr in sb2 is decremented to 0,and the reference count of the shared_ptr in sb1 to incremented to 2.

as for StrBlobPtr,

StrBlobPtr sbp1,sbp2;
sbp1 = sbp2;

there are two non-static data members in class StrBlobPtr,one of which is of type size_t,the other of type weak_ptr.
assigning sbp2 to sbp1 is equivalent to

sbp1.wptr = sbp2.wptr;
sbp1.curr = sbp2.curr;

using the copy-assignment operator of these member types respectively.
copying one weak_ptr to another does not change the reference count of the underlying shared object in dynamic memory.
